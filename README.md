d3-chord-taxes-example
======================

Introducion
-----------
This is a demonstration of how to use the framework [D3.js](https://d3js.org) to create an interactive chord diagram. This chord diagram represents the *2014 U.S. Tax Distribution by State*, and it is able to show how a given state contributes to each category in the total U.S. tax collection as well as how the tax revenue of each state breaks down into the different categories. Raw data for this example can be found [here](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk). This example is based on Steve Hall's [d3-chord-diagrams](https://github.com/sghall/d3-chord-diagrams) examples.
